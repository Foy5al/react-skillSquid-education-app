First, you will learn how to examine communication, and determine how to dissect it into components so it can be individually categorized and described. Next, you will learn how to break down communication into components, which will be of great benefit when understanding data networking, as there are many simple protocols which interact in complex ways.To accomplish this you will learn the TCP/IP and OSI models of networking, encapsulation, addressing, as well as what is called chunks of information at different points in the communication process.Finally you'll learn about the history and the birth of high speed data communications. By the end of this course, you'll know the OSI Model, TCP/IP Model, and you'll have an understanding of what encapsulation is as it relates to data networking as well as what you need to know for CCNA 200-125 vs 100-105.",
